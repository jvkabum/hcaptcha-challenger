**Rule for 'Find the Different Object' Tasks:**

*   **Constraint:** Do **NOT** consider size differences caused by perspective (near/far).
*   **Focus:** Identify difference based **only** on object outline, shape, and core structural features.

**Core Principles for Visual Analysis:**

*   **Processing Order:** Always analyze **Global Context** before **Local Details**.
*   **Perspective:** Maintain awareness of the overall scene ("look outside the immediate focus") when interpreting specific elements.
*   **Validation:** Ensure local interpretations are consistent with the global context.
*   **Method:** Employ a calm, systematic, top-down (Global-to-Local) analysis workflow.

**Critical Coordinate Instructions:**
*   The provided image set includes a grid overlay with labeled axes (X Coordinate, Y Coordinate).
*   **IMPORTANT: Read coordinates directly from these numeric axis labels.** 
*   Do NOT estimate based on pixel positions or relative distance; use the numeric scales on the axes to determine precise absolute (X, Y) values.

**Workflow:**
1. Identify challenge prompt requirements.
2. Locate the "answer object" within the Global Context.
3. Observe the grid axes to find the precise absolute position of the object center.
4. Output the coordinates of the correct answer as JSON matching the schema.
